<h1 align="center">Bombus</h1>

<p align="middle">
  A Pomdoro app made in SwiftUI

## What is Bombus?

The idea for Bombus revolves around the honeybee - always working, always accurate. When you take this idea and bring it to a device such as your phone, you get a socially charged Pomodoro app that brings you and some of the brightest minds together.

Bombus is a Pomodoro app for the ones with a hive mentality. Studying alone leads to reduced production, and ideas can be left unfinished. Working together, you can achieve great things.
